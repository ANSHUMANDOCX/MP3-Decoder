## 10/24/2025 12 AM - Began with Reading Datasheets  

Read the Data sheet of the DF robot mp3 player and Atmega328p. Also i will be using a 3.7 LiPo battery with it so i would need to step up the voltage to 5v for the module and Atmega328p IC run properly. 
Thinking of using mt3608 step up ic.
Will also be adding a charging circuit to make it as portable as possible. 
Thinking of adding a OLED display to it for seeing the status and track playing but no sure about it since i will need to design a enclosure incase i am adding one. Also adding it will cause a significant dip in the backup time . will decide later

## 10/24/2025 1 PM - completed the schematic   

Began with sourcing the Symbol and Footprint for the DF mini mp3 player. Took a look at existing circuits using base atmega328p. Also decided to add a ADC pin to constantly monitor the battery voltage and show the playtime left on the oled. 
visually the schematic needs some more polishing will do it later.

## 10/25/2025 - Polished the schematic and Routed the PCB  

I properly labelled the sections of the Schematic and made it look cleaner.
Started out with the PCB completed routing and turns out finding the exact package of the component u have with u in kicad is a challenge.
Spent a considerable amount of time just looking at the PCB after complete routing to find the best and the most optimized route for a trace as possible. The pcb still needs some more work more of adding graphics and test points.
