## 10/24/2025 - Began with Reading Datasheets  

Read the Data sheet of the DF robot mp3 player and Atmega328p. Also i will be using a 3.7 LiPo battery with it so i would need to step up the voltage to 5v for the module and Atmega328p IC run properly. 
Thinking of using mt3608 step up ic.
Will also be adding a charging circuit to make it as portable as possible. 
Thinking of adding a OLED display to it for seeing the status and track playing but no sure about it since i will need to design a enclosure incase i am adding one. Also adding it will cause a significant dip in the backup time . will decide later
